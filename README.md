● Create a service with get method using any data.json file and
● Create a method in your component to call that service and render that data to your view

<u>Notes:
1. I have used angular-cli for this project and so it will run with command:
`ng serve` on localhost:4200
2. * Service is in product.service
    * data.json contains data to be rendered
    * component is in app.component
    * view rendered in app.component.html
